## Details 
We had an idea and we thrived upon it with our knowledge of semantic HTML5, CSS3 and Flexbox .
We used the designing tool Figma and with the help of google forms we managed to complete our 'Contact Us' section. 
Just a little time management, teamwork and coordination led to completion of this beautiful project.
